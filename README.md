# What Agritracter aims at doing
This mini app is meant to help small farmers track when they planted a crop, how many days have passed, and how many days are left until harvest. It’s like a mini logbook but on a computer or phone.

Why it’s important:

Many farmers don't use tech.

Some forget when they planted crops.

This helps them plan better—when to water, fertilize, or harvest.
